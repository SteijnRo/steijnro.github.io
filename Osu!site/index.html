	   The game called "Osu!" is a rythem game with thousands of players every day.<br>
	   The premise of the game is simple, click the circles to the beat, but in <br>
	   practice, the game is harder than you would think at first. <br>

	<p>
		This website was made to show you the top players of the game.<br>
		The players are devided in multiple different classes, jumping, streaming and consistancy.<br>
		<br>
		Jumping is the most obvious one, the better a player can move their cursor across the screen <br>
		with good accuracy and speed, the higher a player scores on the leaderboard.
		<br>
		Streaming is when you have to click a lot of circles in rapid succession.<br>
		If you look at the video above, you will see a player play a map called: "freedom dive"<br>
		The map is a notourious streaming map, with a lot of really hard and fast streams.<br>
		So it comes down to this, the faster a player can stream and with good accuracy, the <br>
		higher they score.<br>
		<br>
		Consistancy is the hardest one to explain, cause it's based on opinion.<br>
		My take on consistancy is the following; when a player plays maps, they get good combos<br> 
		and get good accuracy. (a combo is when you hit circles in a row, giving more and more <br>
		points with the higher combo you get) When a player can get high combos and good accuracy<br>
		most of the time, the player is consistant. The more they can get good scores in  a row, the<br>
		higher the player scores on the leaderboard.
