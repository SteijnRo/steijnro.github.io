	<h1>San Holo</h1>
	
	<h2>and his career</h2>
	
	<p>
  San Holo is a Future Bass music producer from the netherlands. He likes <br>
  to remix songs from all kinds of games, or just other people's songs. <br>
  He does this in such a good way that he has created a massive following <br>
  of at least 100 million.
	</p>
  
	<p>
	Not only does he remix songs, but he makes them too. He created hits like <br>
  "light" or "we rise". Both of these songs have a combind total of views of <br>
  105 million views, light having 'only' 15 million views* and "we rise" having <br>
  90 million views.* He has more songs than just these two, of course, but these <br>
  are the songs I personally like the most.
